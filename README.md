This project aims to make it simpler to make sure your Xcode-based projects are automatically built when changes show up in git. 
- It won't build your Rails stuff
- It won't build your PHP stuff
- It won't build your Java stuff
- It *will* build your iOS Projects
- IT *will* build your OS X Projects

# Contribution

Here's a few simple requests I have for code contributions:

- We won't be paying attention to pull requests that don't contribute to the current milestone we're working on.
- Keep the coding style consistent, we try to stick with Apple's recommended style guidelines.

Thanks!
